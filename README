dependencies: gnuradio, python std libs

File Description:

psk_simu.py -   Main block of the program. Contains the main code.
utils.py -      Utility library. Contains a channel model, usefull dictionaries and BER estimator.

bersink.py -    BER visualizer (Modified version of number sink)
constsink.py	Constelation Sink (Modified version)
fftsink.py	FFT Sink (Modified version)
fftwin.py	FFT Window (Modified Version

Getting started:

Just run psk_simu.py and control the parameters:

SNR: Signal to Noise Ratio (in dB)
Bandwidth: Bandwidth of the passband signal (in kHz)
Fading: Rayleigh fading based on Doppler Spectrum.
	Parameter is equal to log(Fd.Ts), where Fd is Doppler Shift Frequency and Ts is the sinalization period.
